      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been convinced for a while now that Fedora is the cleanest, most &amp;ldquo;put together&amp;rdquo; of the mainstream Linux distros. With the release of Fedora 33, I was finally persuaded to make the move from Arch Linux to Fedora on my main workstation, in no small part because I really wanted to see what the Fedora team was doing with BTRFS. Call me disappointed when I found out that all they had really done with BTRFS was set it as default and roll a somewhat uninspired subvolume layout, but we&amp;rsquo;ll try to wrap our head around what we can do with the default setup.</description>
